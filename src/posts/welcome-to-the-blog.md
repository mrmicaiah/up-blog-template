Welcome to your new blog! This is a sample post to help you get started.

## Getting Started

To add new posts, create markdown files in the `src/posts/` directory. Each post should have frontmatter at the top with the following fields:

- `title` - The post title
- `date` - Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `excerpt` - A short summary for post cards
- `image` - Featured image URL
- `author` - Author name
- `tags` - Array of tags

## Customizing Your Blog

Edit `src/_data/site.json` to customize:

- Site name and tagline
- Colors and fonts
- Social links
- Analytics IDs
- API configuration

## Building Your Site

Run `npm run dev` for local development with live reload, or `npm run build` to generate the static site in `_site/`.

Happy blogging!
